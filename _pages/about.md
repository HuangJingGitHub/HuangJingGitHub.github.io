I was a Postdoc Researcher at the Multi-Scale Medical Robotics Center, Hong Kong, and also with the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, working with Prof. [Kwok Wai Samuel Au (Sam)](https://biomedirobotics.com/au-kwok-wai-samuel/). 

I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2023, under Sam's supervision. During my Ph.D., I worked as a member of the [Bioinspired Robotics & Medical Technology Group (BMT)](https://biomedirobotics.com/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in mechanical and automotive engineering from Tsinghua University in 2017.

My research interests mainly lie in robot manipulation, robot vision, and motion and path planning. Particularly, my research used to focus on manipulation of deformable objects in unstructured conditions of grasping, contacts, and environments. I am now actively exploring techniques that could enable more general deployment of robotics, including fundamental planning and learning approaches. However, I am currently a robotics researcher, not an embodied AI researcher.

<!---Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.--->
